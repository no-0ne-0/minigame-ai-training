# minigame-ai-training

This is an old project I found on my folders, I think it's the first "usable" thing I did. The code is kinda bad and it doesn't quite work but I decided to post it here anyway.

It's a very simple game where the AI has to dodge some squares. Made in pygame because it looked like the simplest option at the time

The training is also very simple, just basic evolutionary algorithm using multiprocessing. As I said it doesn't work properly, it always stagnates at some point and stops getting better. Probably random mutation wasn't the best choice to it, it just seemed cool at the time so I did it.

Finding this was a good way to see how much I improved. Maybe I will try to make a version of it with reinforcement learning or anything that will make it actually work someday.
